                            Dr. Annie Roach is the founder of White Pine Equine Veterinary, established in 2024. A Nevada native, she discovered her passion for equine medicine early on while competing in show jumping across the West Coast. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of California, Davis in 2013, then went on to earn a Master’s in Assisted Reproductive Technologies from Colorado State University in 2016.
While in Fort Collins, Annie met her husband, Zach, and the two relocated to his home state of Minnesota, where she earned her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Minnesota. During vet school, Dr. Roach served as president of the Student Chapter of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, deepening her commitment to the equine veterinary field.
Dr. Roach’s professional interests include equine sports medicine, emergency and critical care, senior horse wellness and integrative medicine. She completed her veterinary acupuncture training in 2022, adding a valuable tool to her whole-horse approach to care.
Annie has been practicing in the Treasure Valley since 2021 and is excited to be building lasting relationships with horses and their people across the region. When she’s not working, Annie enjoys camping, baking cakes, and exploring mountain trails on horseback with her husband, Zach, riding their mustangs and accompanied by their two dogs.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">Our general medicine services form the foundation of lifelong health and wellness for horses of all ages, disciplines, and lifestyles. We provide individualized care plans that prioritize disease prevention, early detection, and proactive health management.
Routine vaccinations are essential to protect against common infectious diseases such as West Nile Virus, Eastern and Western Encephalitis, Tetanus, Rabies, Influenza, and Equine Herpesvirus. We tailor vaccination protocols based on your horse’s age, risk factors, travel schedule, and exposure level.
Deworming strategies are designed with current resistance concerns in mind. Rather than a one-size-fits-all schedule, we recommend fecal egg counts and targeted deworming protocols to ensure effective parasite control while minimizing resistance development.
We also offer senior wellness exams focused on maintaining comfort, function, and quality of life for aging horses. These exams may include metabolic testing, dental evaluations, lameness assessments, and nutritional counseling to address the unique needs of older equine patients.
For horses with conditions such as insulin dysregulation, Cushing’s disease (PPID), or equine metabolic syndrome, we develop custom metabolic management plans. These plans often include diagnostic testing, dietary adjustments, and regular monitoring to manage weight, hoof health, and overall well-being.
Our mare and foal services include pre- and post-partum care, neonatal exams, and early life wellness checks. We monitor both mare and foal closely to ensure a healthy start and address any complications promptly.
Whether you're managing a performance horse, a broodmare, or a retired companion, our general medicine services are designed to support your horse’s health through every stage of life.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">At White Pine Equine, we take a comprehensive approach to equine sports medicine and lameness care, recognizing that optimal performance and soundness require more than just treating pain—it means addressing the whole horse, inside and out.
Our evaluation begins with a detailed clinical exam to assess gait, posture, and biomechanics, often supported by advanced diagnostic imaging including digital radiographs, ultrasound, and nerve blocks to precisely localize sources of pain or dysfunction. We collaborate closely with farriers and trainers to evaluate hoof balance, saddle fit, and conditioning programs—all key factors in preventing and managing lameness.
We utilize therapies such as Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injections, which promote healing of soft tissue injuries by harnessing the horse’s own growth factors, and shockwave therapy to stimulate circulation and accelerate repair in tendons, ligaments, and joints. These treatments are part of individualized rehabilitation plans designed to restore function, reduce inflammation, and improve athletic longevity.
Beyond addressing acute injuries, we focus on preventative care through regular performance evaluations and wellness exams tailored to the needs of equine athletes. Whether your horse is a top-level competitor or a weekend trail partner, we work to restore optimal movement and long-term soundness.
By combining thorough diagnostics, advanced therapies, and a team-based approach, we help you maintain your horse’s health and keep them moving strong season after season.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">Equine dental care is more than just floating sharp points—it’s a vital part of your horse’s overall health, comfort, and performance. As licensed veterinarians, we bring extensive training, advanced equipment, and a deep understanding of equine anatomy and pathology to every dental exam.
Veterinary dentistry allows for a comprehensive oral evaluation, not just filing down enamel overgrowths. We assess for abnormalities such as tooth root infections, fractured teeth, periodontal disease, malocclusions, and tumors, many of which are missed without sedation and a full oral examination using a speculum and proper lighting and sometimes radiographs. Because we approach dentistry as a medical procedure, we ensure your horse receives safe, hygienic, and evidence-based care every time. Our ability to sedate the horse safely and thoroughly evaluate the entire mouth AND horse health sets us apart from non-veterinary practitioners.
Dental problems can contribute to poor performance, weight loss, behavior issues, and chronic pain. Routine dental exams, typically recommended once or twice yearly, help prevent these problems and allow us to address issues early—before they become serious or irreversible.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">Accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of effective veterinary care. At White Pine Equine, we offer a comprehensive range of diagnostic services to evaluate your horse’s health from the inside out—whether you're addressing lameness, internal illness, metabolic concerns, or reproductive function.
Our laboratory testing includes everything from routine panels to specialized screenings. We commonly run CBC and chemistry panels to assess organ function, hydration, and signs of infection or inflammation. We also offer Serum Amyloid A (SAA) testing for real-time monitoring of systemic inflammation, which is particularly useful in cases of infection, fever, or post-surgical care.
For horses with metabolic or endocrine concerns, we provide insulin testing, ACTH testing for PPID (Cushing’s disease), and complete hormone panels to support diagnosis and management of reproductive or performance-related conditions. We also offer Vitamin E and Selenium testing, which are essential for proper neuromuscular function and are often deficient in our region. Additionally, Coggins testing for Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) is available for routine travel or sale requirements.
Our diagnostic imaging capabilities include both digital radiography and ultrasound, allowing us to evaluate bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue structures with precision. We regularly perform farrier radiographs (also known as hoof balance films) to assist in hoof care planning, laminitis monitoring, and corrective shoeing. These films provide vital insights into hoof-pastern alignment, sole depth, and overall hoof balance, ensuring farriers and veterinarians can collaborate effectively on your horse’s soundness.
Whether investigating lameness, internal disease, metabolic imbalance, or performance issues, our diagnostic tools help us get to the root of the problem—so we can treat your horse quickly, accurately, and confidently.

                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">Equine acupuncture is an evidence-supported adjunct to traditional veterinary medicine that can enhance treatment outcomes for a range of conditions, particularly those involving musculoskeletal and neurological systems. This modality involves the precise placement of thin needles at specific anatomical points to stimulate nerves, increase circulation, and promote the release of endogenous anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving substances. Acupuncture has been shown to help manage back pain, muscle tension, joint stiffness, and even gastrointestinal motility issues. It is a valuable tool used across a wide spectrum of cases—from managing chronic conditions in geriatric horses to enhancing performance and recovery in athletic horses. Acupuncture is often incorporated alongside conventional diagnostics and therapies to support a comprehensive, integrative approach to equine health and recovery.</p>
